‚úÖ How FOL is Simulated in Our Code
We are not using a logic engine like Prolog or Experta. But we‚Äôre mimicking FOL behavior like this:

üìò Example Rule in FOL:
scss
Copy
Edit
HasSymptom(x, fever) ‚àß HasSymptom(x, cough) ‚Üí HasCondition(x, flu)
üßë‚Äçüíª Corresponding Python Code:
python
Copy
Edit
for condition, data in knowledge_base.items():
    match_count = sum(symptom in user_symptoms for symptom in data["symptoms"])
    if match_count > 0:
        matched_conditions.append((condition, match_count, data["advice"]))
This checks:

How many symptoms the user has that match the knowledge base

If enough symptoms match a condition ‚Üí we infer that condition

üí° So What‚Äôs "FOL" Here?

FOL Concept	Your Code Equivalent
HasSymptom(x, fever)	"fever" in user_symptoms
‚àß (logical AND)	Multiple matches in match_count
‚Üí HasCondition(x, flu)	Adding "flu" to matched_conditions
Knowledge base as rules	knowledge_base dictionary
Logical inference engine	infer_conditions() function
üîç Summary
While this chatbot doesn't use a formal FOL engine, it simulates FOL logic through:

Pattern-based rule definitions (symptoms ‚áí condition)

Logical rule matching (AND-ing symptoms)

Inference output (suggesting diagnosis)
